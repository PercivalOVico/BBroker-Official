# CORRECT COMMANDS TO RUN

## ⚠️ COPY THESE EXACT COMMANDS (NOT THE MARKDOWN TEXT!)

---

## Option 1: Use the Quick Start Script (EASIEST)

bash start.sh

---

## Option 2: Run Commands Individually

# Command 1: Install dependencies
npm install

# Command 2: Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Command 3: Start server (on port 5001 to avoid conflicts)
npm run dev

---

## Option 3: All in One Line (COPY THIS EXACTLY)

npm install && npm run db:push && npm run dev

---

## If Port 5001 is ALSO Busy

# Use a different port:
PORT=3000 npm run dev

# Or kill processes:
bash scripts/kill-port.sh
